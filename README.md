# 👋 Hey there, I'm Tahsincan Köse

Founder of [HisseVergiBeyan](https://www.hissevergibeyan.com/) and senior robotics software engineer at Aeolus Robotics focused on household manipulation for mobile service robots. Lately I've been extending our reactive action processor with new manipulation skills, stewarding fetch-and-delivery, disinfection, door-manipulation, and elevator pipelines, and playing a significant role in developing custom grippers (plus a novel UVC disinfection device) tailored to those deployments.

Right now my core emphasis is learning-enabled manipulation with large models 🤖. I built the online planning and execution pipeline that exposes trajectory rollouts and reward signals for on-robot learning, integrated the cuRobo GPU planner so expert trajectories arrive fast enough to iterate, and designed the planning skill-benchmark suite—covering skills like button-pushing, grab, dispose, and door-sliding—to keep behavior regressions visible.

Before Aeolus, I wrote guidance, navigation, and control software for DJI Matrice 100 platforms at MilSOFT. I implemented the autonomy stack, spun up a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation and hardware-in-the-loop lab ✈️, and connected embedded controllers with mission software so flight-readiness checks could run overnight across swarms of test vehicles.

These days I'm applying vision-language-action pipelines and large behavior models to a humanoid robot mounted on a mobile base, wiring up logging, visualization, and curation workflows that make large-scale learning iterations feasible. Always happy to compare notes with anyone exploring dependable robotic behavior at scale 🤝.

## 🏦 Fintech
- Built HisseVergiBeyan into a detailed tax-reporting assistant for Türkiye-based investors trading on foreign stock exchanges—it's humming along even without active development these days.
- Automating profit and loss breakdowns with verbose explanations of splits, delistings, and TRY inflation adjustments so annual filings stay accurate.

## 🤖 Robotics
- Extending manipulation skill coverage across fetch-and-delivery, disinfection, door-manipulation, and elevator missions with custom grippers.
- Maintaining articulated collision object libraries and telemetry-fed online replanning pipelines for humanoid deployments.
- Stewarding skill-level benchmarking infrastructure—covering button-push, grab, dispose, and door-slide behaviors—to keep regression detection grounded in real deployments.
- Contributed upstream improvements to MoveIt, MoveIt Tutorials, and ros_comm.
